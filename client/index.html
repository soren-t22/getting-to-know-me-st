        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am from Minnesota and have lived there my whole life except for college.
            My parents are Keely and Erik, and my two younger sisters are Ava and Kajsa.
            I am a senior this year here at Lewis double majoring in computer science and mathematics.
            I also play on the lacrosse team here as a defenseman. 
            My sisters both go to school at UND, the University of North Dakota. 
            Ava is a junior commercial aviation major.
            Kajsa is a freshman nursing major, and she's also on the track team dong pole vault there.
            My family is mostly Swedish and Danish as my grandma on my moms side moved to Wisconsin with her family from Sweden when she was 5.
            And my great grandparents on my dads side moved to Wisconsin from Denmark before having my grandma.

        <h2>What I hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
        <p>
           <ul>
               <li>If I enjoy software engineering and want to pursue a career in it.</li>
               <li>What it is that software engineers do.</li>
               <li>How to be a good software engineer.</li>
           </ul> 
        </p>

        <h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of hobbies that I enjoy doing. 
            Some include, playing video games, playing board games and card games, disc golfing, longboarding, rollerblading, and many others.
            The one I will talk more about today is my love for the trading card game Magic: The Gathering.
            Magic is a trading card game meaning that cards can be collected and or played.
            Think Pokemon, but I don't just collect the cards, I create decks and play them against my friends decks.
            The problem with trading card games is that they can become expensive very fast.
            Especially if you want good cards, they usually cost more so it can almost end up pay to win.
            Reguardless I love thinking of new decks that I could build and how I can upgrade my already existing decks to make them better.
        </p>

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>I think the most interesting fun fact about me is that my family co-owns 2 different cabins.
            We own a cabin in Alaska and a cabin in Colorado. Our cabin in Alaska is on a river and we go once a year to catch salmon.
            Our cabin in Colorado is about 30-45 minutes from A-basin or Keystone so we usually go in the winter to ski.
            My family and the people we own them with have done a lot to improve both places since we've bought them.
